# Mock Data Generator

A simple project designed to create mock datasets for testing, prototyping, or demonstrating data-driven applications. With customizable options, this tool allows you to generate realistic datasets quickly and efficiently.

Most of the ideas came from [FakerPHP](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker) and [Mackoroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

click you can see live [demo](generate-mock-data.vercel.app).

## Features

- **Customizable Data Schema**: Define your dataset structure and data types with ease.
- **Multiple Data Types**: Supports various fields like integers, floats, strings, dates, and more.
- **Randomized but Realistic**: Generates data with realistic constraints and patterns.
- **CSV Export**: Save generated datasets to CSV for easy integration.
- **Extensible**: Modify or extend the code to suit your specific use case.
